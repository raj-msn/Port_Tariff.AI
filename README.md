# PortTariff.AI: South-African Port Tariff Calculator

PortTariff.AI is an intelligent, AI-powered API that automates the calculation of South African port tariffs directly from unstructured vessel data. Built with FastAPI and powered by Google's Gemini Pro, it provides a seamless, accurate, and developer-friendly solution for the maritime industry.

The application is containerized with Docker for easy setup and has been successfully deployed to the Render cloud platform, making it a robust and scalable solution.

## 🚀 Getting Started: Local Setup

You can run the application locally using either Docker (recommended) or a standard Python environment.

### Option 1: Docker (Recommended)

This is the fastest and most reliable way to run the application, as it mirrors the production environment.

**Prerequisites**:
-   Docker & Docker Compose installed.

**Steps**:
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/raj-msn/PortTariff.AI.git
    cd PortTariff.AI
    ```
2.  **Create your environment file:**
    Copy the example `.env` file and add your Gemini API key.
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    # Now, edit the .env file and paste your API key
    ```
3.  **Build and run with Docker Compose:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
    The application will now be running at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

### Option 2: Python Virtual Environment

**Prerequisites**:
- Python 3.11+

**Steps**:
1. **Clone and set up the environment file** as described in the Docker steps.
2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
3. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. **Run the FastAPI server:**
    ```bash
    uvicorn api:app --reload
    ```
    The application will now be running at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

## 🧪 Testing the API

A test script `test_api.py` is included to verify the functionality of the API endpoints. It is pre-configured to test the live Render deployment but can be easily switched to a local server.

1.  **Ensure the server is running** (either via Docker or locally).
2.  **To test the live Render API**, simply run:
    ```bash
    python test_api.py
    ```
3.  **To test your local server**, open `test_api.py` and change the `BASE_URL` to `http://localhost:8000`.

## 🛰️ API Documentation & Usage

The API is documented using OpenAPI (Swagger UI), which provides an interactive way to explore and test the endpoints.

**API Docs URL**:
-   **Live**: [https://port-tariff-ai.onrender.com/docs](https://port-tariff-ai.onrender.com/docs)
-   **Local**: [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)

### Endpoints

#### 1. Health Check

-   **Endpoint**: `GET /`
-   **Description**: Checks if the API is running and available.
-   **Success Response** (`200 OK`):
    ```json
    {
      "status": "ok"
    }
    ```

#### 2. Calculate Tariffs

-   **Endpoint**: `POST /calculate-tariffs`
-   **Description**: Calculates port tariffs from unstructured vessel data.
-   **Request Body**:
    -   `vessel_info` (string): A multi-line string containing all the vessel details.
    -   `requested_dues` (list[string], optional): A list of specific dues to calculate. If `null` or omitted, all available tariffs will be calculated.
-   **Success Response** (`200 OK`):
    ```json
    {
      "results": {
        "Port Dues": "ZAR 199,371.35",
        "Light Dues": "ZAR 60,062.04",
        "VTS Dues": "ZAR 33,345.00"
      }
    }
    ```

### Example API Requests

#### cURL (Command Line)

This command can be run from any terminal (Git Bash, macOS, Linux).
```bash
curl -X POST "https://port-tariff-ai.onrender.com/calculate-tariffs" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "vessel_info": "Port: Durban\nVessel Name: SUDESTADA\nGT: 51,300\nDays Alongside: 3.39\nActivity: Exporting Iron Ore",

## ☁️ Deployment

This application is deployed on **Render** using its Docker container runtime. The deployment is automatically triggered by pushes to the `master` branch of the source GitHub repository.

-   **Platform**: Render
-   **Service Type**: Web Service
-   **Runtime**: Docker
-   **GitHub Repo**: [raj-msn/PortTariff.AI](https://github.com/raj-msn/PortTariff.AI)

The deployment process uses the `Dockerfile` in the root of the repository to build and run the container. The `GEMINI_API_KEY` is securely configured as an environment variable in the Render dashboard.

## 🏗️ Project Architecture

-   `api.py`: The main FastAPI application file. It defines endpoints, handles requests, and coordinates with the tariff engine.
-   `tariff_engine/`: The core logic package.
    -   `chatbot.py`: Contains the `PortDuesChatbot` class, which interacts with the Gemini API. It manages the rules extracted from the PDF and performs the calculations.
    -   `prompts.py`: Stores the prompt templates sent to the Gemini model for rule extraction and calculation.
    -   `constants.py`: Defines a list of all calculable `DUES_TYPES`.
-   `main.py`: A legacy entry point for a command-line chat interface (not used by the API).
-   `Dockerfile`: Defines the Docker image, installing dependencies and copying all necessary files.
-   `docker-compose.yml`: Orchestrates the local Docker setup, including port mapping and environment variable injection.
-   `Port Tariff.pdf`: The source document containing all the tariff rules and regulations.
-   `rubrics.md`: A markdown file where the AI's extracted rules from the PDF are stored (this file is generated on first run if it doesn't exist).

## Logging

The API includes comprehensive logging:
- All requests and responses are logged with unique request IDs
- Detailed calculation steps and results are tracked
- Logs are written to both console and `api.log` file (UTF-8 encoded)
- Different log levels for debugging and production use
- Windows-compatible text symbols (no emoji issues)

### Example request

```bash
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/calculate-tariffs" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ 
        "vessel_info": "Vessel Name: SUDESTADA\nGT: 51300\nLOA: 229.2\nDays Alongside: 3.39\nPort: Durban",
        "requested_dues": ["Port Dues", "Light Dues", "Pilotage Dues"]
      }'
```

### Response

```json
{
  "results": {
    "Port Dues": "ZAR 199,549.22",
    "Light Dues": "ZAR 60,062.04",
    "Pilotage Dues": "ZAR 47,189.94"
  }
}
```

The API internally re-uses the same logic as the CLI (`python main.py`), ensuring consistency.
